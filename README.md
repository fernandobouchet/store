Please note that this is a demo project; it does not feature real products, prices, or payment methods, and no actual purchases can be made.

This is a fictional e-commerce web application developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ,It allows users to explore products, add items to a cart, and save favourites. The application leverages Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance and fast loading, creating a smooth, responsive interface across all devices.

The product data is retrieved from a mock API hosted on [my-json-server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/), which serves test data for demonstration purposes.

## Key Features

1. **Product Catalogue**: Explore a curated selection of products with detailed information, including prices, descriptions, and images. Users can navigate categories and view product listings optimised with Static Site Generation (SSG) for faster load times.

2. **Cart and Favourites Management**: Users can add items to their shopping cart and save favourites for later. The cart and favourites lists are stored persistently in localStorage, allowing users to return and continue shopping without losing their selections. 

3. **User Interaction**: Easily manage item quantities in the cart with update and remove options, providing a user-friendly shopping experience.
   
4. **Responsive Design**: The web app is fully responsive, offering an optimised experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
